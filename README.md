# Agrochain-A-Blockchain-Based-Agricultural-Supply-Chain
## Problem statement:
- In the recent past, we have read many incidents regarding farmer suicides due to debts and poor yield from farming. For a country like India, with the rise in - - population, dependency over the land for building houses and industrial areas is increasing rapidly. The fertile land for farming is dwindling and more yields have to be produced to satisfy the needs of the country. 

- Even though the demand increases, the farmers are suffering from some major issues like **raising initial investments, fetching reasonable prices, analysing market trends,disputes with middlemen and finally issues in transportation and storage.**

## Objective:

- The main aim/objective behind choosing such a project is because the agricultural industry is one of the industries which faces a lot of criticism and too many Farmer deaths are reported every day. According to the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data on accidental deaths and suicides, **10,281 farmers** committed suicide in 2019. The main reasons for these suicides being unable to pay hefty interest rates on loans. **Now what if we directly establish a link between the product consumers and the Farmers, this is what is the focus of our project i.e to help farmers raise the amount required for their cultivation using the concept of crowd funding from the consumers.**

- One more important objective the project focuses on is that of eradicating a broker or a middleman which not only reduces the final product MRP, but also helps to reduce the adulteration and other intermediary offences. Here only the customers and farmers are there to monitor the entire process in a blockchain, this creates an even more transparent and trustful environment.

## Introduction:

- **Agrosahakar** is a blockchain based transparent marketplace where the farmers and consumers could implement a co-operative farming method. Here, the farmers can list the potential crops and the expected yield on his farm on the distributed public ledger. The consumers can view the details and check for the farmer's credibility based on the previous cultivation and supply. 

- This creates a transparent and tamper-proof digital market platform for farm products. Thus an agreement (consensus) can be formed between farmer and consumer, such that the consumer can fund individual crops or a field and can acquire the yield from the farm or the profit percentage of its market value. There will be a rating mechanism to build the credibility of farmer and consumer based on the previous experiences in the agromarket.

## Methodology:

![Flowchart](https://github.com/kuluruvineeth/Agrochain-A-Blockchain-Based-Agricultural-Supply-Chain/blob/main/screenshots/AgriChain.jpg)

## These are the features or methodologies implemented for the project:
### 1. Registration form for Farmers:
- The details we ask while registration are:Farmer id, Farmer name, location, Crop name, phone number, quantity and expected price.
- The entered details are directly stored onto the blockchain.

### 2. Quality testing: 
- Here we get the farmers details mentioned above by entering the Farmer id.
- Once the quality testing is done the block number is assigned and approved details will provide the details of the farmer.
- Approved details button will redirect to the product details page where we enter the lot number, grade, price, test date, expiry date and store these details into the ledger as a set of transaction details.

### 3. Customer: 
- In this page the customer has to enter the Farmer id and lot number to see the status of quality testing of his agricultural produce.

### 4. Micro-finance: 
- This form enables any user to fund the farmer.
- The funding is done by providing the farmerâ€™s public id, lot number of the product and the amount.
